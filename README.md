# Digital-Systems-Project
It is of ever-increasing importance within pedagogical practice to provide interactive activities to cater to the varying academic abilities of individual students. An early years student can neither log in, nor select their appropriate level of academic challenge due to their inability to read or type.

This software will explore the use of student identification using a camera, with the intention to provide individuals with interactive activities tailored to their current level of development. The goal of this project is to use facial analysis to identify and track student’s current emotions, adapting activities accordingly to try and improve their experience whilst using the software. The way in which students interact with the activity in terms of correct answers and emotions can then be recorded and tracked for analysis by the teachers.

## In order to run this software, the follwoing software packages need be installed:
